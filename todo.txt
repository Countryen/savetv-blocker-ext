- IDEA: DETAILS-Button (options-page)
- IDEA: Add "WHEN ADDED" to the entry-data.
- IDEA: EN support
- IDEA: Screen-shots (store)
- IDEA: Help-functions (?i?)
- IDEA: Documentation + Let users know that it works logged in / logged out.
- IDEA: GitHub

- PROBLEM: Matches for the context-menu-item (not all "entries" are supported yet)

- Publish when done (v7?)
- Refactoring still needed

- REQUEST (FR): Options -> Let the user know "You have to click on ... to ..." (not a help-function)
